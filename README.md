# Mono Game Template 2D

Just trying to figure out how this all works.

### Setup

#### deps

Make sure to have dotnet 3.1 installed: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Mono will be required for the build pipeline: https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/

On Mac the simplest solution is to just: `brew install mono` 

#### install libraries

In this repo: `dotnet restore`

### Run

In this repo: `dotnet run`
